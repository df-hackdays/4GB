# 4GB
We are 4GB (Girl and Boy)

We are solving problem statement 3:

Problem Statement:
How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for children or those that are newer to technology

Our Approach:
To solve problem 3, we can use such techniques as quizzes, assignments, in-class and out-of-class participation, and final project. To increase the engagement of students, we can use such online tools as slack and piazza. To those with disabilities, we can have special classes with either visual aids, hearing aids, and helper students. Additionally, we can pair strong students with weaker students in order to imporve the learning experience.

For the data analysis, we can use Python/Tableau. For data storage, we can use MySQL server.
