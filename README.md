# 4GB
We are 4GB (Girl and Boy)


How do we manage a room of learners with different
experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for
mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and
are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for
children or those that are newer to technology.
